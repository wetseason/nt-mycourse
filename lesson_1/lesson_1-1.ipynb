When you click and interact with websites through a [graphical user interface (GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface), what makes that possible is the code running behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is essentially what python is, a language that allows us to communicate with our computers to do and create useful things. It can also be used in a variety of domains, from developing websites and mobile phone applications, to creating games and analysing data. Although the focus of this course will on the latter category, data analysis, our hope is that by the end of the course, the transition from data analytics to any of the other domains in which python operates, would be a smooth one for you.\n",

    "### A bit of history\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created in the late 1980's by [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/), a retired dutch programmer who's most recent role was at [dropbox](dropbox.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it so popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an excellent language with a lot of funtionalities, but one of its best characteristics is the plethora of [modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) it has available to increase our performance and improve our workflow when analysing data. You can think of these modules or libraries of code as the additional benefits of this language. Here is a metaphor to give you an example, we humans are very awesome just the way we are born (e.g., without clothes, language, knowledge, etc.), but in order to function better in society, and cruise through different stages of our lives, we make use of different languages and objects that provide us with a better experience. The clothes, the accessories, and the languages we use are our added benefits just like modules and packages are Python's benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ We will be using library, module, and package interchangeably throughout this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules that make up most of the data analytics ecosystem (and the ones we will use the most in this course), are the following ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) -> \"is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) -> \"is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things, a powerful N-dimensional array object, sophisticated (broadcasting) functions, tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code, useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) -> \"is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Data Visualisation\n",
    "\n",
    "- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) -> \"is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) -> \"s a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/index.html) -> Although Altair has not had the same adoption from the community as the previous two data visualisation libraries, it is a great library for visualising your data.\n",

    "1. To work in and with Python we need to understand the data it understands. These data types can be strings, integers, floating point numbers, and booleans.\n",
    "2. To hold on to data we use a combination of variables and data structures. Variables are like a bucket that holds in information for us, and data structures hold multiple bit of information in them. Data structures can be lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.\n",
    "3. A lot of people have written very useful code that we can exploit and save time with. They have packaged their code into libraries and we can download them using `pip` in the command line.\n",
    "4. Doing something repeatadely is called a loop.\n",
    "5. Creating logical conditions to evaluate different arguments, can be accomplished with if-then statements.\n",
    "6. Instead of writing code over and over again, we can put our code into functions for reusabiliy.\n",
    "7. To ask the users of our programs to tell us things, we take advantage of the `input()` function.\n",
    "8. Jupyter lab will be our best friend for writing code.\n",
    "9. Git and GitHub will make sure we never lose our work."
